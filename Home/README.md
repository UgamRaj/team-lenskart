## Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, we faced a few challenges, including:

- Implementing responsive design for a variety of screen sizes.
- Implementing the carousel effect using optimized java script and outer library.
- Achieving pixel-perfect styling and layout was time-consuming, especially given the rich design of the Lenskart website.

To overcome these challenges, we have explore through different platforms and with help of mentor and team work.
